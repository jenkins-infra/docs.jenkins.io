== How to Build the Versioned Documentation Locally with Antora

The documentation site for Jenkins is split into two parts:

[start=1]  
. **Version-controlled documentation** (managed using Antora) 
. **Non-versioned documentation** (using Gatsby for rendering the current website)

This guide focuses on building the version-controlled documentation using Antora.

=== Installing the Prerequisites

[start=1]  
. **Install Node.js and npm**
+
It is recommended to install Node.js and npm using the Node Version Manager (nvm):
* NVM repository: [https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
+
Alternatively, you can download and install Node.js from the official Node.js website:
* Node.js official website: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
+
After the installation, verify that both `node` and `npm` are correctly installed:
+
[source,bash]
----
node --version
npm --version
----

. **Install Antora CLI**
+
Antora is used for generating versioned documentation. Install it globally via npm:
+
[source,bash]  
----
npm install -g @antora/cli @antora/site-generator-default
----

=== Installing Project Dependencies

Once Node.js, npm, and Antora are installed, install the dependencies by running the following command at the root of the repository:

[source,bash]  
----
npm i
----

=== Building the Versioned Docs

To build and serve the site locally, use the provided Makefile. Run this command at the root of the repository:

[source,bash]  
----
make all
----

Once the site is up and running, it should be available locally at:

* link:http://127.0.0.1:8080/[http://127.0.0.1:8080]

== Documentation Structure

* **Antora Documentation**: This version-controlled documentation covers different guides (e.g., Developer Guide, User Guide).
* **Gatsby Documentation**: Non-versioned content managed via Gatsby. This forms the basis of the current link:https://jenkins.io/[https://jenkins.io/] site, which will be replaced in the future. For more details on how to work with the Gatsby site, refer to its dedicated README documentation at:
** link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/docs.jenkins.io/tree/main/site#readme/[https://github.com/jenkins-infra/docs.jenkins.io/tree/main/site#readme/][https://github.com/jenkins-infra/docs.jenkins.io/tree/main/site#readme/]
