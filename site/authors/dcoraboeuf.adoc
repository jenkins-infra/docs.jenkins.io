I've started many years ago in the Java development before switching progressively toward continuous delivery aspects.  
I'm now a consultant implementing CD solutions based on Jenkins. 
Implementation of the Pipeline as Code principles have allowed one of my clients to be able to manage more than 3000 jobs, using a self service approach based on the Seed plugin.

I'm also a contributor for some Jenkins plugins and the author of the Ontrack application, which allows the monitoring of continuous delivery pipelines.
