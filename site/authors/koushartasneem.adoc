I am Tasneem Koushar and I have worked at Chromium under Google Summer of Code 2021 and successfully created automated documentation of Puppeteer.

I want to help contributors at Jenkins and am interested in becoming one of the mentors for the link:/projects/gsoc/2022/project-ideas/pipeline-step-documentation-generator/[pipeline step documentation generator project].
