Bruno is a father of two, husband of one, geek in denial, beekeeper, link:https://permies.com/[permie] and a Developer Relations for the Jenkins project. He's been tinkering with continuous integration and continuous deployment since 2013, with various products/tools/platforms (Gitlab CI, Circle CI, Travis CI, Shippable, Github Actions, ...), mostly for mobile and embedded development. He's passionate about embedded platforms, the ARM&RISC-V ecosystems, and Edge Computing. His main goal is to add FOSS projects and platforms to the ARM&RISC-V architectures, so that they become as link:https://twitter.com/jonmasters/status/1523041597683683328[boring] as X86_64. He is also the creator of link:https://minijen.rocks/[miniJen], the smallest multi-cpu architectures Jenkins instance known to mankind.
