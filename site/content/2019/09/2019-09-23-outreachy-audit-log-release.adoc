Thanks to our Outreachy interns over the past year, I'm proud to announce the initial release of the https://plugins.jenkins.io/audit-log[Audit Log plugin for Jenkins].
This plugin is the first major project completed related to https://www.outreachy.org/[Outreachy], and I'd like to give a brief overview of the functionality that was developed for this release.
The primary goal of this plugin is to introduce an audit trail of various Jenkins events using structured logging and related https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424[audit logging standards].
Initially, this plugin covers audit events related to core Jenkins concepts like user accounts, jobs, builds, nodes, and credentials usage.
More specifically, this tracks:

* User login and logout events
* Credentials usage
* User creation (when using the Jenkins user database as a security realm)
* User password updates (ditto)
* Starts and ends of builds
* Creation/modification/deletion/copying of items (which correspond to projects, pipelines, folders, etc.)
* Creation/modification/deletion of nodes.

This plugin defines and exports standardized log event classes and schemas corresponding to these events.
Other plugins can add `audit-log` as a dependency to define their own audit events using https://logging.apache.org/log4j-audit/latest/[Apache Log4j Audit] and its https://logging.apache.org/log4j-audit/latest/catalog.html[catalog editor]; then they can use the https://logging.apache.org/log4j-audit/latest/log4j-audit/log4j-audit-maven-plugin/index.html[Maven plugin] for generating the audit event classes for use in the plugin.

The other major feature of this plugin is configuring where to output these audit logs.
By default, audit logs will be written in HTML files (rotated once per day) to `$JENKINS_HOME/logs/html/audit.html` which are viewable through the "Audit Logs" root action link.
In the system settings, a section for audit logging is added where the main audit log output can be configured.
This can initially be configured to output via either a JSON log file in `$JENKINS_HOME/logs/audit.log` by default or to a syslog server using RFC5424 encoding.

Overall, this experience has been rather interesting.
Besides having an opportunity to mentor new contributors, Outreachy has helped open my eyes to the struggles that developers from around the world are dealing with which can be improved upon to help expand our communities.
For example, many countries do not have reliable internet or electricity, so the use of synchronous videoconferencing and other heavyweight, synchronous processes common to more corporate-style development are inadequate in this international context.
This doesn't even begin to account for the difference in timezones which is not always an issue, though both problems are addressable by using asynchronous communication methods like chat and email.
This notion of asynchronous communication is an important aspect of the https://www.apache.org/theapacheway/[Apache Way], for example, which emphasises processes that allow for vendor neutral communities to form and thrive around a project.

This mentoring project was valuable to myself as well.
As a software engineer myself, project management is not my specialty, so this gave me a great opportunity to develop my own PM skills and technical leadership.
My own typical discovery process for feature development involves experimenting directly with the code to see what features make sense to prioritize and which would take a vast effort to implement.
Changing my own discovery process to avoid implementing the features myself was difficult to adjust to, though I did defer any of my own feature contributions to this plugin until after the initial release.
In order to appropriately scope the project, I still had to spend a bit of time reading through the Jenkins codebase to determine which tasks could be implemented simply (e.g., good newbie-friendly issues), which tasks might require changes to Jenkins itself (previously discovered to take too long for these relatively short Outreachy rounds), and which tasks would require intimate familiarity with Jenkins and would likely be infeasible for new developers to Jenkins.
Thanks to the work done in discovery and delivery, I've also identified potential features for Log4j itself which could be used in future versions of this plugin.

Overall, I think we did a good job of balancing the scope of this project without spending too much time in any specific area.
The first release of this plugin is now available in the Jenkins Update Center.
In the future, I hope to learn more about developing Jenkins UI components so that we can create a more dynamic and Jenkins-like configuration page for choosing where logs are output.
While I don't intend on using this plugin for further Outreachy rounds, I do hope to see more interest in it over time as the more security-conscious users out there discover this new plugin.
