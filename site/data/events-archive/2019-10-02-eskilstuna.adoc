Jenkins Configuration as Code (a.k.a jcasc) and pipelines

It's time to talk about Jenkins Pipelines!

Ewelina Wilkosz (Praqma, Malm√∂) will demonstrate Jenkins Configuration as Code plugin.
Alexandra Sedova (also Praqma, Stockholm) will share her experience with pipelines - she has been working with Jenkins pipelines quite some time and finds them a very powerful approach to creating delivery chains.
Pipelines and jcasc together are an easy way to keep your complete CI as code.
