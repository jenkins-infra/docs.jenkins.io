==== JNLP4 remoting protocol enabled by default

The JNLP4 protocol is now enabled by default for JNLP agent connections.
It's more reliable than JNLP3, and also encrypted, making it the best choice for agent connections.
Use of this protocol may require upgrades of `slave.jar` files on agents.

==== Obsolete ciphers removed from SSHD

Jenkins exposes an SSH server that allows use of CLI commands via SSH.
In this SSH server, support for the obsolete ciphers AES128CBC, TripleDESCBC, and BlowfishCBC has been removed.
