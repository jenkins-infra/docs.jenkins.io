==== Changes to on-disk storage layout for user records

link:/security/advisory/2017-11-08/[SECURITY-499]

The fix for SECURITY-499 renames the directories containing user records in `JENKINS_HOME/users/`:
Directories with unsafe names, like reserved names such as `NUL` (Windows) or using unsafe characters such as `\` will be renamed to filesystem-safe representations of those user names, with problematic characters or sequences escaped.

Downgrading Jenkins to versions older than 2.73.3 would result in a mismatch between the name widely used to reference a user in Jenkins (such as assigned permissions), and what user name is associated with the user's metadata (password record for Jenkins user database, SSH public key, and various preferences) -- as the latter might change to the filesystem-safe representation of the intended user name -- and is therefore discouraged.
