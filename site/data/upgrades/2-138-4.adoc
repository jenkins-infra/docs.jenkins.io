[#SECURITY-1072]
==== Migration of user records

link:/security/advisory/2018-12-05/#SECURITY-1072[SECURITY-1072]

After applying this upgrade, Jenkins will migrate the user records to a slightly different storage format that uses a central index to map user IDs to directory names.
This is a backwards incompatible change, so older releases of Jenkins will not be able to deal with the new storage format.
We strongly recommend taking a full backup of at least the `$JENKINS_HOME/users/` directory before upgrading.

If Jenkins crashes or is killed during startup, the migration may be incomplete, possibly making a subset of user records unavailable.
To determine whether this is the case, check for the existence of the file `$JENKINS_HOME/users/users.xml`.
If it does not exist, but user directories have been renamed as described below, the migration was interrupted.
In such cases, if no backup is available, we recommend checking the Jenkins system log and using the information in it to restore directories to their previous names.
The log entries look similar to the following message:

----
INFO: Migrating user 'admin' from 'users/admin/' to 'users/admin_6635238516816951048/'
----

In this case, rename the directory `$JENKINS_HOME/users/admin_6635238516816951048/` to `$JENKINS_HOME/users/admin/` while Jenkins is not running.
Repeat this for all other user directories listed in the log.
Doing all of the above will undo the partial migration.
Jenkins will re-run it on the next startup.

If Jenkins needs to be downgraded after an update and successfully applied user directory migration, do all of the above and additionally delete the `$JENKINS_HOME/users/users.xml` file.
This reverts the migration and restored all user records to a format compatible with Jenkins 2.138.3 and earlier.

IMPORTANT: Please note that downgrading Jenkins is not generally supported, and may fail for reasons unrelated to this migration.


[#SECURITY-595]
==== New restrictions on HTTP request routing

link:/security/advisory/2018-12-05/#SECURITY-595[SECURITY-595]

A design flaw in the Stapler web framework allowed accessing fields and invoking methods that were not intended to be invoked this way by accessing specific URLs.
link:/security/advisory/2018-12-05/#SECURITY-595[For further details, see the security advisory].

As a side effect of this security fix, some HTTP requests will no longer work as before.
This typically results in `HTTP 404 Not Found` responses, although a very small subset of requests will be successful, but the response will simply be different than it would have been before the fix was applied.
Whenever either happens, Jenkins write a message similar to the following to the Jenkins system log:

----
WARNING: New Stapler routing rules result in the URL "/example" no longer being allowed. If you consider it safe to use, add the following to the whitelist: "method hudson.model.Hudson doExample". Learn more: https://jenkins.io/redirect/stapler-routing
----

If this happens due to legitimate use of the Jenkins UI, the affected signature can be added to the list of approved signatures.
To do this, run the following command in the Jenkins script console as administrator:

----
jenkins.security.stapler.StaticRoutingDecisionProvider.get().add('method hudson.model.Hudson doExample')
----

This will create a file called `stapler-whitelist.txt` in the Jenkins home directory, and add the specified entry.
This file can also be modified manually, but the following script needs to be executed afterwards to apply any changes if Jenkins is already running:

----
jenkins.security.stapler.StaticRoutingDecisionProvider.get().reload()
----

We track known affected plugins and their status in link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Plugins+affected+by+the+SECURITY-595+fix[the Jenkins wiki].
