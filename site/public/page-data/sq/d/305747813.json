release cadence has accelerated significantly in recent years.\nAt present, Java feature releases are delivered <a href=\"https://blogs.oracle.com/java/post/moving-the-jdk-to-a-two-year-lts-cadence\">every six months</a>,\nwith a long term support (LTS) release <a href=\"https://blogs.oracle.com/javamagazine/post/java-long-term-support-lts\">every two years</a> that is supported for about six years.\nJava feature releases are conceptually analogous to Jenkins <a href=\"https://www.jenkins.io/download/weekly/\">weekly releases</a> in that they allow developers to release early and often,\nwhile Java LTS releases are conceptually analogous to Jenkins <a href=\"https://www.jenkins.io/download/lts/\">LTS releases</a> in that they benefit large scale users.\nThe similarity between Java releases and Jenkins releases ends at the conceptual level, though — in practice,\neach project has a vastly different schedule regarding\nhow often each type of release is performed and how long each type of release is supported.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_two_categories_of_users\">Two categories of users</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The above illustrates the needs of two categories of users:\ndevelopers and early adopters, who benefit from releasing early and often;\nand large scale users, for whom predictability and stability are the primary consideration.\nThe latter will tend to prefer both Jenkins and Java LTS release lines and delay upgrading\nuntil after the early adoption phase has passed or until it is absolutely necessary to upgrade.\nThe changes to Java’s release schedule in recent years raise the question of\nhow to align Java adoption within the Jenkins project with Java’s own release cadence,\nwhich has accelerated significantly in recent years.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"_rejected_proposal_support_three_java_lts_releases_at_any_given_time\">Rejected proposal: Support three Java LTS releases at any given time</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a href=\"https://adoptium.net/support/\">Eclipse Temurin</a> and <a href=\"https://access.redhat.com/articles/1299013\">Red Hat</a> both support their Java LTS releases with security patches for about six years,\nand in practice Java vendors will continue to maintain a Java LTS release for as long as there is market demand for it.\nOne answer to the question raised above, then, would be for the Jenkins project to support each Java LTS release for six years,\nmatching the support offered by upstream Java vendors like Eclipse Temurin and Red Hat.\nThis strategy primarily benefits large scale users for whom stability is the primary consideration,\nbut for various reasons that we will explore below it fails to meet the needs of developers and early adopters.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image\"><img src=\"/images/images/post-images/2023/11/06/introducing-2-2-2-java-support-plan-figure2.svg\" alt=\"Figure 2\" title=\"Rejected proposal: Support three Java LTS releases at any given time\"></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"_rejected_proposal_support_one_java_lts_release_at_any_given_time\">Rejected proposal: Support one Java LTS release at any given time</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>At the other end of the spectrum, the Jenkins project could support each Java LTS release\nfor only as long as it takes for the next Java LTS release to be delivered; i.e., for two years rather than six.\nThis strategy would benefit developers and early adopters,\nand these benefits go beyond the mere availability of shiny new language features for developers —\nnewer Java runtimes have implemented a significant number of performance optimizations that are of interest to operators,\nand an increasing number of third-party library dependencies require the adoption of a recent Java LTS release\nin order to receive bug fixes and security patches.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Additionally, the Jenkins ecosystem consists of thousands of loosely-connected components,\nand building and testing them across all supported Java versions is a nontrivial effort,\nnotwithstanding recent advances in dependency updating.\nReducing the build and test matrix to a single version would save hundreds of thousands of dollars in cloud costs,\nto say nothing of the savings in development costs\nthat are associated with the decreased cognitive load of a simpler build and test matrix.\nHowever, this strategy fails to meet the needs of large scale users,\nwho want to adopt a Java LTS release and stick with it for as long as possible\nbefore upgrading to the next Java LTS release.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image\"><img src=\"/images/images/post-images/2023/11/06/introducing-2-2-2-java-support-plan-figure3.svg\" alt=\"Figure 3\" title=\"Rejected proposal: Support

plan</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The above discussion highlights two categories of users,\neach of whose needs are legitimate but, through no fault of their own, are in conflict with each other.\nThe natural solution, then, is to compromise at the midpoint.\nTherefore, the Jenkins project is adopting a 2 + 2 + 2 Java support plan, where Jenkins\nsupports a new Java LTS release in the first two years after the general availability of that Java LTS release,\nthen requires that Java LTS release as the Jenkins minimum Java version in the next two years of that Java LTS release’s upstream support,\nthen drops support for that Java LTS release two years before that Java LTS release reaches end of life upstream.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image\"><img src=\"/images/images/post-images/2023/11/06/introducing-2-2-2-java-support-plan-figure4.svg\" alt=\"Figure 4\" title=\"Accepted proposal: 2 + 2 + 2 Java support plan\"></span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In practice, this means that Jenkins will support a given Java LTS release\nfor approximately two-thirds the amount of time that upstream Java vendors do,\nthat Jenkins will support two Java LTS releases at any given time rather than three,\nand that large scale users can stay on a Java LTS release for four years at a time.\nThis plan balances the needs of large scale users for predictability and stability\nwith the needs of early adopters and developers\nto improve and simplify Jenkins with the latest Java capabilities\nand to reduce the maintenance overhead associated with a large build and test matrix.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_upcoming_dates\">Upcoming dates</h2>\n<div

support plan will take effect as described above.\nCheck this blog for detailed dates at that time.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>These requirements apply to all components of the Jenkins system,\nincluding the Jenkins controller, all types of agents, CLI clients, and other components.\nYou do <em>not</em> need to build your application with the same version of Java used to run Jenkins itself;\nsee the <a href=\"/doc/book/platform-information/support-policy-java/#running-java-based-tools-and-builds-on-jenkins:\">Running Java-based tools and builds on Jenkins</a> section of the documentation.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>As the age-old adage says, a good compromise is when both parties are equally dissatisfied,\nand we recognize that this plan is not ideal for either category of user.\nHowever, we feel that it optimizes globally for the sustained progress of the Jenkins community as a whole,\nensuring that the software and the community around it remain relevant for a wide variety of people and use cases.\nAs the Jenkins project nears its 19th birthday,\nwe look forward to the establishment of a sustainable software development lifecycle\nthat can serve the project’s valued users and contributors for years to come.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","fields":{"slug":"/2023/11/2023-11-06-introducing-2-2-2-java-support-plan/"},"document":{"title":"Introducing the 2 + 2 + 2 Java support

account of my journey to update my Jenkins Servers.\nThink of this as a \"back of the napkin\" guide that I used to research and upgrade my Jenkins Servers, which had been left unattended for far too long.\nI know many of you are seasoned experts - I wasn&#8217;t.\nI&#8217;ve included references that I found useful in my research, but keep in mind, your setup may be different from mine.\nI hope this helps others in their journey.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Yours in Jenkins,\n<a href=\"/author/mwp565733/\">Marc</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"quoteblock\">\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>“This is the way”</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"_pre_work\">Pre-work:</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Grab your plugin list and dive into the <code>Change log</code>.\nYou&#8217;re going to want to pore over EVERY change log from your current version to your target version, and every single iteration in between.\nKeep an eye out for any mentions of your plugins and Java versions (both client and primary) in the Change Log. You&#8217;re building a validation checklist here (e.g., does SSH still work? Is the plugin functioning properly?).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><strong>ADDED ROI</strong>: While you&#8217;re scrutinizing your plugins, take a moment to consider which ones are gathering dust. Are any of them deprecated? Do you still need them? Try deactivating them (before you outright remove them) and see if anyone kicks up a fuss.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><code>Backup Security roles and Users</code>: If you&#8217;re using LDAP/AD, make offline copies of your Security groups and access, User Lists and Security groups (<em>&lt;jenkins_url&gt;/manage/role-strategy/</em> &amp;&amp; <em>&lt;jenkins_url&gt;/manage/role-strategy/assign-roles</em>).\nDon&#8217;t forget to backup configurations to access the Active Directory too (<em>&lt;jenkins_url&gt;/configureSecurity/</em>).</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"_let_the_work_begin\">Let the work begin:</h3>\n<div class=\"olist arabic\">\n<ol class=\"arabic\">\n<li>\n<p>Get cozy with your backups for those inevitable rollbacks.\nI had quite the love affair with plugins&#8230;&#8203; making a tar/zip archive of /JENKINS_HOME/plugins was a lifesaver.\nSome plugins, like <a href=\"https://plugins.jenkins.io/active-directory/\">Active Directory</a>,\nreally threw me for a loop during updates.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>SNAPSHOTS</code>: Take them at the beginning, and after each benchmark, if you can afford the luxury.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>Update Plugins</code>: Aim for the highest compatible level. I found that reaching for the \"highest level\" sometimes led to unnecessary headaches. Keep it simple, kid. <strong>SNAPSHOT:</strong> Archive the &lt;JENKINS_HOME&gt;/plugins/ folder.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>Update the Core application</code>: Stick with the method you used for the initial install.\nI&#8217;m running on RHEL and used yum&#8230;&#8203;\nI tried getting fancy with downloading the war file, but it kept throwing tantrums&#8230;&#8203;\nStick with what you know.\nKeep in mind, versions pre-2.400 used a different security key than post-2.400 (<a href=\"/blog/2023/03/27/repository-signing-keys-changing/\">Jenkins 2.397 and 2.387.2:\nNew Linux Repository Signing Keys</a>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>Update plugins <em>AGAIN</em></code>: Aim for the highest \"compatible\" level (hopefully, it&#8217;s the highest level now).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>Plugin configuration</code>: My CVS plugin was a bit needy, requiring files not in the hpi install file. Follow the appropriate plugin documentation to satisfy these dependencies.\nEstablish connections to external databases and services (AD/CVS/etc.).\n<strong>Special anecdote</strong>: I had a bit of a tiff with the \"Require TLS\" checkbox for the LDAPS connect&#8230;&#8203; a conflict needed to be resolved.\nSpecifically, I had to tweak the systemctl for Jenkins&#8230;&#8203; ensure <code>-Dhudson.plugins.active_directory.ActiveDirectorySecurityRealm.forceLdaps=true</code> was removed before enabling that checkbox, else you&#8217;ll be dealing with authentication errors with LDAPS <sub><a href=\"https://plugins.jenkins.io/active-directory/#plugin-content-encryption-support\">Reference</a></sub></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>Validation</code>: Time to check that list you made earlier&#8230;&#8203; can you SSH out to client servers?\nCan you connect to your external services/databases?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"_cleanup\">Cleanup:</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Depending on the scale of your upgrade, you might want to <code>re-examine your plugins</code>.\nSome plugins might have been sent out to pasture as their functionality gets folded into the Core.\nConsider these plugins for deactivation, and maybe even removal down the line.\nThis little cleanup could help plug some security holes (and put a smile on your CISO&#8217;s face).\nRemember to do a little jig after each disable/remove and application recycle.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_epilogue\">Epilogue</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This is a story without an end&#8230;&#8203;\nIt&#8217;s not a one-and-done deal.\nAfter I finished the upgrade cycle, I made weekly pilgrimages to each server to update plugins, disable ones that seemed to be gathering dust, remove the ones that <em>WERE</em> just collecting dust, and address any warnings that popped up in the Jenkins UI.\nThe more you do it, the easier it gets.\nI had a few practice runs on my sandbox server before I dared to touch the production servers.\nAnd I kept taking snapshots as I went along, like a tourist in my own code.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This is my tale&#8230;&#8203; now it&#8217;s time for you to write yours.</p>\n</div>\n<div

website using Awestruct from AsciiDoc sources.\nOne of the drawbacks of the current build method is that the technical documentation is not versioned.\nIt is thus not possible to view the documentation for a given Jenkins version.\nOnly the latest can be viewed.\nThis can lead to unnecessary confusion and is a worse experience than many other documentation sites like the <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git\">git site</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3.11/\">Python</a>, and others.\nAnother drawback of Awestruct is that for the last two years it has only been maintained by people from the Jenkins project.\nRelying on Awestruct is not a good thing in the long run.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The preferred set of tools that will replace Awestruct are <a href=\"https://antora.org/\">Antora</a> for its out of the box versioning functionality and <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/\">Gatsby</a> for it&#8217;s super fast
