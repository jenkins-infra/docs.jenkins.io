=== `publishIssues`: Publish issues created by a static analysis scan
++++
<ul><li><code>issues</code>
<ul><li><b>Type:</b> <code>class io.jenkins.plugins.analysis.core.steps.AnnotatedReport</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>checksAnnotationScope</code> (optional)
<ul><li><b>Values:</b> <code>ALL</code>, <code>NEW</code>, <code>MODIFIED</code>, <code>SKIP</code></li></ul></li>
<li><code>failOnError : boolean</code> (optional)
<div><div>
 If there are errors while scanning the console log or files for issues (e.g., file pattern matches no files, source files could not be copied, etc.) then the warning plugin will show these errors in a separate view but does not alter the build state. If you would rather like to fail the step on such errors, please tick this checkbox.
</div></div>

</li>
<li><code>healthy : int</code> (optional)
<div><div>
 The healthy threshold defines the limit of warnings for a healthy result: A build is considered as 100% healthy when the number of issues is less than the specified threshold. Values less or equal zero are ignored. So if you want to have a healthy build (i.e., 100%) only for zero warnings, then set this field to 1.
</div></div>

</li>
<li><code>id : String</code> (optional)
<div><div>
 The results of the selected tool are published using a unique ID (i.e. URL) which must not be already used by another tool in this job. This ID is used as link to the results, so choose a short and meaningful name. Allowed elements are characters, digits, dashes and underscores (more precisely, the ID must match the regular expression <code>\p{Alnum}[\p{Alnum}-_]*</code>). If you leave the ID field empty, then the built-in default ID of the registered tool will be used.
</div></div>

</li>
<li><code>ignoreQualityGate : boolean</code> (optional)
<div><div>
 <p>One important feature of the Warnings Plugin is the classification of issues as new, outstanding and fixed. To compute this classification, the plugin requires a reference build (baseline). New, fixed, and outstanding issues are then computed by comparing the issues in the current build and in the baseline.</p>
 <p>If this option is set, only issues that have been introduced in the current build are marked as new. Previously new issues in older builds will be converted to outstanding issues. I.e., if someone starts a new build manually (without source code changes), then no new issues will be in the job anymore.</p>
 <p>By default, this option is disabled: then only a build is selected as reference that passed all quality gates. As soon as a build fails a quality gate, the reference will be frozen until all new issues are resolved again. That means, that new issues will be aggregated from build to build until the original reason for the failure, and all those additional new issues have been resolved. This helps much more to keep your project clean: as soon as there are issues, Jenkins will mark all builds as unstable until the issues have been resolved.</p>
</div></div>

</li>
<li><code>minimumSeverity : String</code> (optional)
<div><div>
 Select which warning severities should be considered when evaluating the build health. The following options are supported: 
 <dl>
  <dt>
   ERROR
  </dt>
  <dd>
   Only consider errors
  </dd>
  <dt>
   WARNING_HIGH
  </dt>
  <dd>
   Consider errors and warnings with high severity
  </dd>
  <dt>
   WARNING_NORMAL
  </dt>
  <dd>
   Consider all severities but not warnings with severity low
  </dd>
  <dt>
   WARNING_LOW
  </dt>
  <dd>
   Consider all severities.
  </dd>
 </dl>
</div></div>

</li>
<li><code>name : String</code> (optional)
<div><div>
 You can override the display name of the tool. This name is used in details views, trend captions, and hyper links. If you leave the name field empty, then the built-in default name of the registered tool will be used.
</div></div>

</li>
<li><code>publishAllIssues : boolean</code> (optional)
<div><div>
 If this option is checked, then the plugin will publish new and outstanding issues to SCM provider platforms. By default, the plugin will only publish new issues.
</div></div>

</li>
<li><code>qualityGates</code> (optional)
<ul><b>Array / List of Nested Object</b>
<li><code>type</code>
<div><div>
 In order to simplify the user interface you can select the property that will be compared with the specified threshold. Basically, three different properties are available: 
 <dl>
  <dt>
   Total
  </dt>
  <dd>
   Selects the total number of issues in the current build.
  </dd>
  <dt>
   New
  </dt>
  <dd>
   Selects the total number of new issues in the current build with respect to the reference build. New issues will be calculated by a sophisticated algorithm that tries to track issues from build to build, even if the source code has been modified. Note that this algorithm sometimes detects outstanding warnings as new, e.g., if a source file has been refactored heavily.
  </dd>
  <dt>
   Delta
  </dt>
  <dd>
   Selects the difference between the total number of issues in the current build subtracted by the total number of issues in the reference build. This is a simple subtraction, so if you have a build that adds a new warning and removes a completely different warning, then the result will be zero.
  </dd>
 </dl> Additionally, you can select to choose all issues, or issues of a given severity only (error, high, normal or low).
</div></div>

<ul><li><b>Values:</b> <code>TOTAL</code>, <code>TOTAL_ERROR</code>, <code>TOTAL_HIGH</code>, <code>TOTAL_NORMAL</code>, <code>TOTAL_LOW</code>, <code>TOTAL_MODIFIED</code>, <code>NEW</code>, <code>NEW_ERROR</code>, <code>NEW_HIGH</code>, <code>NEW_NORMAL</code>, <code>NEW_LOW</code>, <code>NEW_MODIFIED</code>, <code>DELTA</code>, <code>DELTA_ERROR</code>, <code>DELTA_HIGH</code>, <code>DELTA_NORMAL</code>, <code>DELTA_LOW</code></li></ul></li>
<li><code>criticality</code> (optional)
<div><div>
 When a quality gate has been missed, this property determines whether the result of the associated step or the overall build will be marked as unstable or failure. The following enum values are possible for freestyle jobs: 
 <dl>
  <dt>
   UNSTABLE
  </dt>
  <dd>
   Set the step and build status to unstable if the quality gate has been missed.
  </dd>
  <dt>
   FAILURE
  </dt>
  <dd>
   Fail the step and build if the quality gate has been missed.
  </dd>
 </dl> For Pipelines two additional fine-grained options are available, that allow setting the status of the step without touching the overall build status: 
 <dl>
  <dt>
   NOTE
  </dt>
  <dd>
   Set the step to unstable if the quality gate has been missed.
  </dd>
  <dt>
   ERROR
  </dt>
  <dd>
   Fail the step if the quality gate has been missed.
  </dd>
 </dl>
</div></div>

<ul><li><b>Values:</b> <code>NOTE</code>, <code>UNSTABLE</code>, <code>ERROR</code>, <code>FAILURE</code></li></ul></li>
<li><code>integerThreshold : int</code> (optional)
</li>
<li><code>threshold : double</code> (optional)
<div><div>
 The threshold defines the minimum number of warnings that will miss the quality gate. Values less or equal zero are ignored. So if you want to fail a build that has one warning, set this field to 1.
</div></div>

</li>
<li><code>unstable : boolean</code> (optional)
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>quiet : boolean</code> (optional)
<div><div>
 Quiet output to the console log: do not write logging messages to the console log. All logging messages will still be visible in the messages view of the warnings plugin.
</div></div>

</li>
<li><code>scm : String</code> (optional)
<div><div>
 Specify the key of your repository (substring is sufficient) if you are using multiple SCMs in your job. When your job is composed of several SCM checkouts (modules, pipeline libraries, etc.) then Jenkins stores all those repositories in an unsorted way.
</div></div>

</li>
<li><code>skipPublishingChecks : boolean</code> (optional)
<div><div>
 If this option is unchecked, then the plugin automatically publishes the issues to corresponding SCM hosting platforms. For example, if you are using this feature for a GitHub organization project, the warnings will be published to GitHub through the Checks API. If this operation slows down your build or you don't want to publish the warnings to SCM platforms, you can use this option to deactivate this feature.
</div></div>

</li>
<li><code>sourceCodeEncoding : String</code> (optional)
<div><div>
 In order to correctly show all your affected source code files in the detail views, the plugin must open these files with the correct character encoding (UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, etc.). If you leave this field empty then the default encoding of the platform will be used. This might work but is not recommended.
</div></div>

</li>
<li><code>trendChartType</code> (optional)
<div><div>
 If there is more than one static analysis result available then an aggregation trend chart will be shown on the project page that shows the analysis results in a single trend chart. You can choose the position of this aggregation trend: 
 <dl>
  <dt>
   AGGREGATION_TOOLS
  </dt>
  <dd>
   The aggregation trend is shown <b>before</b> all other analysis tool trend charts.
  </dd>
  <dt>
   TOOLS_AGGREGATION
  </dt>
  <dd>
   The aggregation trend is shown <b>after</b> all other analysis tool trend charts.
  </dd>
  <dt>
   TOOLS_ONLY
  </dt>
  <dd>
   The aggregation trend is not shown, only the analysis tool trend charts are shown.
  </dd>
  <dt>
   AGGREGATION_ONLY
  </dt>
  <dd>
   The aggregation trend is only shown, no other analysis tool trend charts are shown.
  </dd>
  <dt>
   NONE
  </dt>
  <dd>
   Neither the aggregation trend nor analysis tool trend charts are shown.
  </dd>
 </dl>
</div></div>

<ul><li><b>Values:</b> <code>AGGREGATION_TOOLS</code>, <code>TOOLS_AGGREGATION</code>, <code>TOOLS_ONLY</code>, <code>AGGREGATION_ONLY</code>, <code>NONE</code></li></ul></li>
<li><code>unhealthy : int</code> (optional)
<div><div>
 The unhealthy threshold defines the limit of warnings for an unhealthy result: A build is considered as unhealthy (i.e. 0% health) when the number of issues is greater than the specified threshold. Values less or equal zero are ignored. So if you want to have a build health of 0% starting with 10 issues, then set this field to 9.
</div></div>

</li>
</ul>


++++
=== `recordIssues`: Record compiler warnings and static analysis results
++++
<ul><li><code>aggregatingResults : boolean</code> (optional)
<div><div>
 By default, each static analysis result will be recorded as a separate result that is presented as an individual Jenkins Action with separate UI and dashboard. If you rather prefer aggregation of the results into a single result (i.e., single Jenkins Action), then activate this check box. You still can see the distribution of issues grouped by static analysis tool in the UI.
</div></div>

</li>
<li><code>checksAnnotationScope</code> (optional)
<ul><li><b>Values:</b> <code>ALL</code>, <code>NEW</code>, <code>MODIFIED</code>, <code>SKIP</code></li></ul></li>
<li><code>enabledForFailure : boolean</code> (optional)
<div><div>
 By default, static analysis results are only recorded for stable or unstable builds, but not for failed builds: analysis results might be inaccurate if the build failed. If recording should be enabled for failed builds as well then activate this check box.
</div></div>

</li>
<li><code>failOnError : boolean</code> (optional)
<div><div>
 If there are errors while scanning the console log or files for issues (e.g., file pattern matches no files, source files could not be copied, etc.) then the warning plugin will show these errors in a separate view but does not alter the build state. If you would rather like to fail the step on such errors, please tick this checkbox.
</div></div>

</li>
<li><code>filters</code> (optional)
<div><div>
 The created report of issues can be filtered afterwards. You can specify an arbitrary number of include or exclude filters. Currently, there is support for filtering issues by module name, package or namespace name, file name, category or type. Include filters will be combined with <code>or</code>, exclude filters with <code>and</code>. If no filter is defined, then all issues will be published. Filters with empty regular expression will be ignored.

</div></div>

</li>
<li><code>skipBlames : boolean</code> (optional)
<div><div>
 If this option is unchecked, then the plugin automatically shows what revision and author (name and email) last modified the lines of the affected files that contain issues. If this operation slows down your build, or you don't want to publish sensitive user data, you can use this option to deactivate this feature.
</div></div>

</li>
<li><code>skipPostProcessing : boolean</code> (optional)
<div><div>
 If this option is unchecked, then the plugin automatically resolves absolute paths, fingerprints, package and module names from the source files in the workspace. If this operation slows down your build, you can use this option to deactivate this feature.
</div></div>

</li>
<li><code>skipPublishingChecks : boolean</code> (optional)

If you leave this field empty then the default encoding of the platform will be used. This might work but is not recommended.
</div></div>

</li>
<li><code>sourceCodeRetention</code> (optional)
<div><div>
 Select the strategy that should be used to store the affected source code files. Storing the affected source code files along with the issues consumes a lot of space on your hard disk for large projects. So if your server has not enough free space available to store the sources for all builds, it might make more sense to store only the sources of the last build. In this case, the plugin will automatically discard old results before the new sources are stored. If you do not need the source files at all, you can deactivate the storing of source code files. The following options are supported: 
 <dl>
  <dt>
   NEVER
  </dt>
  <dd>
   Never store source code files.
  </dd>
  <dt>
   LAST_BUILD
  </dt>
  <dd>
   Store source code files of the last build, delete older artifacts.
  </dd>
  <dt>
   EVERY_BUILD
  </dt>
  <dd>
   Store source code files for all builds, never delete those files automatically.
  </dd>
  <dt>
   MODIFIED
  </dt>
  <dd>
   Store only changed source code files for all builds, never delete those files automatically.
  </dd>
 </dl>
</div></div>

<ul><li><b>Values:</b> <code>NEVER</code>, <code>LAST_BUILD</code>, <code>EVERY_BUILD</code>, <code>MODIFIED</code></li></ul></li>
<li><code>sourceDirectories</code> (optional)
<div><div>
 Some plugins copy source code files to Jenkins' build folder so that these files can be rendered in the user interface together with build results (coverage, warnings, etc.). If these files are not part of the workspace of a build then Jenkins will not show them by default: otherwise sensitive files could be shown by accident. You can provide a list of additional source code directories that are allowed to be shown in Jenkins user interface here. Note, that such a directory must be an absolute path on the <b>agent</b> that executes the build.
</div></div>

<ul><b>Array / List of Nested Object</b>
<li><code>path : String</code>
<div><div>
 Select the path to your source code files. This plugin copies source code files to Jenkins' build folder so that these files can be rendered in the user interface together with the plugin results. If these files are referenced with relative paths then they cannot be found by the plugin. In these cases you need to specify one or more relative paths within the workspace where the plugin can locate them. Alternatively, you can also specify absolute paths if the source code files are stored outside the workspace (in a directory on the agent). All absolute paths must be additionally approved by an administrator in Jenkins' global configuration page.
</div></div>

</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>tool</code> (optional)
<div><div>
 For each static analysis tool a dedicated parser or scanner will be used to read report files or produce issues in any other way. If your tool is not yet supported you can define a new Groovy based parser in Jenkins system configuration. You can reference this new parser afterwards when you select the tool 'Groovy Parser'. Additionally, you provide a new parser within a new small plug-in. If the parser is useful for other teams as well please share it and provide pull requests for the <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/warnings-ng-plugin/pulls" rel="nofollow">Warnings Next Generation Plug-in</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/analysis-model/pulls" rel="nofollow">Analysis Parsers Library</a>.
</div></div>

<ul><b>Nested Choice of Objects</b>
<li><code>acuCobol</code><div>
<ul><li><code>id : String</code> (optional)
<div><div>
 The results of the selected tool are published using a unique ID (i.e. URL) which must not be already used by another tool in this job. This ID is used as link to the results, so choose a short and meaningful name. Allowed elements are characters, digits, dashes and underscores (more precisely, the ID must match the regular expression `\p{Alnum}[\p{Alnum}-_]*`). If you leave the ID field empty, then the built-in default ID of the registered tool will be used.
</div></div>

</li>
<li><code>name : String</code> (optional)

 In order to read all characters of your reports correctly, the plugin must open these files with the correct character encoding (UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, etc.). If you leave this field empty, then the default encoding of the platform will be used. This might work but is not recommended.
</div></div>

</li>
<li><code>skipSymbolicLinks : boolean</code> (optional)
<div><div>
 Skipping symbolic links is useful when the scanned directory contains links that create a recursive structure. Note that this option may not work on Windows, since symbolic links are not fully supported here.

 For each static analysis tool a dedicated parser or scanner will be used to read report files or produce issues in any other way. If your tool is not yet supported you can define a new Groovy based parser in Jenkins system configuration. You can reference this new parser afterwards when you select the tool 'Groovy Parser'. Additionally, you provide a new parser within a new small plug-in. If the parser is useful for other teams as well please share it and provide pull requests for the <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/warnings-ng-plugin/pulls" rel="nofollow">Warnings Next Generation Plug-in</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/analysis-model/pulls" rel="nofollow">Analysis Parsers Library</a>.

<li><code>unhealthy : int</code> (optional)
<div><div>
 The unhealthy threshold defines the limit of warnings for an unhealthy result: A build is considered as unhealthy (i.e. 0% health) when the number of issues is greater than the specified threshold. Values less or equal zero are ignored. So if you want to have a build health of 0% starting with 10 issues, then set this field to 9.

<li><code>filters</code> (optional)
<div><div>
 The created report of issues can be filtered afterwards. You can specify an arbitrary number of include or exclude filters. Currently, there is support for filtering issues by module name, package or namespace name, file name, category or type. Include filters will be combined with <code>or</code>, exclude filters with <code>and</code>. If no filter is defined, then all issues will be published. Filters with empty regular expression will be ignored.

<li><code>scm : String</code> (optional)

</div></div>

</li>
<li><code>sourceCodeEncoding : String</code> (optional)
<div><div>
 In order to correctly show all your affected source code files in the detail views, the plugin must open these files with the correct character encoding (UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, etc.). If you leave this field empty then the default encoding of the platform will be used. This might work but is not recommended.
</div></div>

</li>
<li><code>sourceCodeRetention</code> (optional)
<div><div>
 Select the strategy that should be used to store the affected source code files. Storing the affected source code files along with the issues consumes a lot of space on your hard disk for large projects. So if your server has not enough free space available to store the sources for all builds, it might make more sense to store only the sources of the last build. In this case, the plugin will automatically discard old results before the new sources are stored. If you do not need the source files at all, you can deactivate the storing of source code files. The following options are supported: 
 <dl>
  <dt>
   NEVER
  </dt>
  <dd>
   Never store source code files.
  </dd>
  <dt>
   LAST_BUILD
  </dt>
  <dd>
   Store source code files of the last build, delete older artifacts.
  </dd>

<li><code>sourceDirectories</code> (optional)
<div><div>
 Some plugins copy source code files to Jenkins' build folder so that these files can be rendered in the user interface together with build results (coverage, warnings, etc.). If these files are not part of the workspace of a build then Jenkins will not show them by default: otherwise sensitive files could be shown by accident. You can provide a list of additional source code directories that are allowed to be shown in Jenkins user interface here. Note, that such a directory must be an absolute path on the <b>agent</b> that executes the build.
</div></div>

<ul><b>Array / List of Nested Object</b>
<li><code>path : String</code>
<div><div>
 Select the path to your source code files. This plugin copies source code files to Jenkins' build folder so that these files can be rendered in the user interface together with the plugin results. If these files are referenced with relative paths then they cannot be found by the plugin. In these cases you need to specify one or more relative paths within the workspace where the plugin can locate them. Alternatively, you can also specify absolute paths if the source code files are stored outside the workspace (in a directory on the agent). All absolute paths must be additionally approved by an administrator in Jenkins' global configuration page.
</div></div>

</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>tool</code> (optional)
<div><div>
 For each static analysis tool a dedicated parser or scanner will be used to read report files or produce issues in any other way. If your tool is not yet supported you can define a new Groovy based parser in Jenkins system configuration. You can reference this new parser afterwards when you select the tool 'Groovy Parser'. Additionally, you provide a new parser within a new small plug-in. If the parser is useful for other teams as well please share it and provide pull requests for the <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/warnings-ng-plugin/pulls" rel="nofollow">Warnings Next Generation Plug-in</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/analysis-model/pulls" rel="nofollow">Analysis Parsers Library</a>.
