The Maven HPI Plugin is used to build and package Jenkins plugins.
It also provides a convenient way to run a Jenkins instance with your plugin:

[source,bash]
----
mvn hpi:run
----

NOTE: You may need to specify a port number for your plugin to use. You can specify a port like this 
[source,bash]
----
mvn hpi:run -Dport=5000
----

NOTE: To learn more about Maven HPI Plugin and the goals it provides, see link:https://jenkinsci.github.io/maven-hpi-plugin/[its documentation].

This will set up a Jenkins instance on `\http://localhost:8080/jenkins/`. Wait for the following console output, then open a web browser and look at what the plugin does.

INFO: Jenkins is fully up and running

NOTE: The Jenkins home directory used is the `work/` directory in the plugin directory. This means that subsequent runs will keep their data.

Create a new freestyle project in Jenkins, and give it any name.

Then add the "Say hello world" build step. It will look like this:

image::images:ROOT:developer/tutorial/job-config.png[Freestyle job configuration]

Enter a name, save the project, and start a new build. Navigate to the build on the UI, and click _Console Output_ to view the build log.
It will contain a message written by the build step that was just configured:

[listing]
----
Started by user anonymous
Building in workspace /Users/mrjenkins/demo/work/workspace/testjob
Hello, Jenkins! // <1>
Finished: SUCCESS
----
<1> The Greeting added by the build step

// TODO This is not present in version 1.2 of the archetype
//Additionally, the build step has global configuration options. Go to _Manage Jenkins » System_ and you'll see this:
//
//image::developer/tutorial/system-config.png[System configuration]

Let's stop Jenkins by pressing `Ctrl-C` (or your system's equivalent) in the terminal.
