= Architecture

:page-layout: wip

This section provides a high level overview of the Jenkins architecture.
The audience is Java developers familiar with Jenkins (as users) who want to understand how Jenkins works internally.

== Dataflow diagram

This dataflow represents Jenkins as a "box". The goal is to have a view of network flow that goes in and out.

This diagram is a high level view centered on Jenkins core.

Please note that:

- some plugins such as the LDAP plugin can contribute to add new network flow.
- All port numbers can be changed by configuration.  The port in the diagram is the default port
- Jenkins can be configured to use TLS (HTTPS)
- It's not mandatory to have all agent types, there is one instance of each agent to illustrate communication types
