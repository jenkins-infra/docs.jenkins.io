= Jenkins and Ruby

Jenkins integrates well with the Ruby toolchain for common tasks that many Ruby
developers are already running locally. Tasks such as executing
link:https://rspec.info/[RSpec] or link:https://cucumber.io/[Cucumber],
generating documentation, running code analysis tools and deploying Ruby
software can all be done through Jenkins.


== Integrating test results

Many tools, like Cucumber, can natively output JUnit-formatted XML which
integrates by default into Jenkins via the "Publish JUnit test result report"
Post-build Action. For tools which do not generate the appropriately
formatted XML by default, there are gems which add the necessary formatters,
such as link:https://github.com/ci-reporter/ci_reporter[ci_reporter].

By integrating the test reports into Jenkins, you can generate trends and
reports. There are other plugins, such as the
{plugin}email-ext[Email Ext plugin]
which can also make use of these machine-readable test reports to send
email notifications with only the failing test cases listed.

Using plugins such as the {plugin}cucumber-testresult-plugin[Cucumber Test Result plugin]
improve the integration and discoverability of successful/unsuccessful
Cucumber scenarios.

By integrating these tools into Jenkins, team members no longer need to
attempt to parse thousands of lines of console output, but instead can more
easily find the important information about a build.
