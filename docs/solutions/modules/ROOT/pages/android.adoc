As one of the predominant mobile platforms, Android is attractive to a number
of developers, but it does bring it's own set of challenges with it. With an
extremely broad set of devices available on the market, building and testing
for the matrix of device configurations can be very challenging. With the
{plugin}android-emulator[Android emulator plugin]
however, it is possible to build and test on a myriad of emulated devices.

When combined with the
{plugin}google-play-android-publisher[Google Play Publisher plugin],
Android developers can build true continuous delivery
pipeline, sending builds to an alpha channel in Google Play for release or
further testing.
