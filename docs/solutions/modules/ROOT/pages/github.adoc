= Jenkins with GitHub

Jenkins, itself link:https://github.com/jenkinsci[located on GitHub], has a
number of plugins for integrating into link:https://github.com[GitHub]. 
The primary avenues for integrating your Jenkins instance with GitHub are:

* "build integration" - using GitHub to trigger builds
* "authentication integration" - using GitHub as the source of authentication information to secure a Jenkins instance.

== Build integration

With the help of the {plugin}git[Git plugin]
Jenkins can easily pull source code from any Git repository that the Jenkins
build node can access.

The {plugin}github[GitHub plugin] extends
upon that integration further by providing improved bi-directional
integration with GitHub. Allowing you to set up a link:https://developer.github.com/webhooks/#service-hooks[Service
Hook] which will hit
your Jenkins instance every time a change is pushed to GitHub.

Going the other direction, the GitHub plugin can also feed information back
into GitHub via the link:https://github.com/blog/1227-commit-status-api[commit status
API], more details

== Authenticating with GitHub

Using the {plugin}github-oauth[GitHub Authentication plugin]
it is possible to use GitHub's own authentication scheme
for implementing authentication in your Jenkins instance.

The **{plugin}github-oauth#plugin-content-setup[setup guide]**
will help walk you through configuring the GitHub OAuth side, and your
Jenkins instance, to provide easy authentication/authorization for users.
