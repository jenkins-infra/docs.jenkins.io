= Jenkins C/C++ Support
:page-partial:

Jenkins provides robust support for C and C++ projects, enabling efficient continuous integration and delivery pipelines for system software, embedded applications, and performance-critical solutions.

== Building C/C++ Projects

Jenkins integrates seamlessly with all major C/C++ build systems:

* **Make/Ninja**: Execute builds through shell steps
* **CMake**: Use the {plugin}cmakebuilder[CMake Plugin] for configured builds
* **Autotools**: Run `./configure` scripts with environment customization
* **Cross-compilation**: Manage toolchains with {plugin}custom-tools-plugin[Custom Tools Plugin]

== Testing and Analysis

* **Unit Testing**: Process results from Google Test, Catch2, and CppUnit with {plugin}xunit[xUnit Plugin]
* **Static Analysis**: Integrate Clang-Tidy, Cppcheck with {plugin}warnings-ng[Warnings Next Generation Plugin]
* **Code Coverage**: Generate reports using gcov and {plugin}cobertura[Cobertura Plugin]

== Cross-Platform Support

Jenkins supports matrix builds for multiple platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS) with consistent toolchains and environments.

== Embedded Development

Special considerations for firmware projects:

* Hardware resource management with {plugin}throttle-concurrents[Throttle Concurrent Builds Plugin]
* Build reliability with {plugin}build-timeout[Build Timeout Plugin]
* Device flashing automation
