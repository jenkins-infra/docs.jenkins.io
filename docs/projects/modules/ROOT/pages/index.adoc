= Jenkins Sub-projects

At the heart of the Jenkins project exists the automation engine's
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins[core] and hundreds of
link:https://plugins.jenkins.io[plugins]. There are
however other collaborative initiatives going on under the umbrella of the
Jenkins project which grow or expand the project in new ways.

== Blue Ocean

Blue Ocean is a project that rethinks the user experience of Jenkins, modelling
and presenting the process of software delivery by surfacing information that's
important to development teams with as few clicks as possible, while still
staying true to the extensibility that Jenkins always has had as a core value.


Blue Ocean also incorporates "The Jenkins Design Language (JDL)" which is a
standardized set of components and a style guide that help developers create
plugins which effortlessly retain the look and feel of the Blue Ocean user
experience.

== Document Jenkins on Kubernetes

image:images:ROOT:gsod/gsod.png["Google Season of Docs", width=128]

Kubernetes is a platform-agnostic container orchestration tool created 
by Google and heavily supported by the open-source community as a project 
of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. Kubernetes is compatible with the 
majority of CI/CD tools which allow developers to run tests, deploy builds 
in Kubernetes and update applications with no downtime.


Jenkins on Kubernetes is a popular theme for Jenkins users. There are a lot 
of presentations and articles about running Jenkins on Kubernetes, however, 
there's currently no central location for documentation describing Jenkins 
on Kubernetes. This project would create a new Kubernetes Volume which would 
describe the concepts, techniques, and choices for Kubernetes users running Jenkins.

== Google Summer of Code

The
link:https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/[Google Summer of Code]
(GSoC) project is an annual, international, program which encourages
college-aged students to participate with open source projects during the summer
break between classes. Students accepted into the program receive a stipend,
paid by Google, to work well-defined projects to improve or enhance the Jenkins
project.  In exchange, numerous Jenkins community members volunteer as "mentors"
for students to help integrate them into the open source community and succeed
in completing their summer projects.

== Infrastructure

image:images:ROOT:network-workgroup.png["Infrastructure", width=128]

As an independent open source project, Jenkins maintains most of its own
infrastructure including services which help keep the project running.
The kinds of things that fall into "infrastructure" can span from operating
virtual machines and distribution networks, to project-specific applications
developed to make the development of Jenkins core and plugins more efficient.

There are various sub-groups and opportunities to contribute to the
link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra[Jenkins project's infrastructure].

== Jenkins Area Meetups

image:images:ROOT:user.svg["Social Jenkins events", width=128]

Jenkins Area Meetups (JAMs) are local meetups intended to bring Jenkins users
and contributors together for socializing and learning.
JAMs are organized by local Jenkins community members who have a passion for
sharing new Jenkins concepts, patterns and tools. JAMs can be found
link:https://www.meetup.com/pro/cicd-cdf/[around the world], and if there isn't a
JAM in your city, you could be the one to start it!

Jenkins Area Meetups are driven by local organizers but receive support from
the Jenkins project via swag (stickers, etc), promotion, and help bootstrapping
and operating the meetup group.

== Jenkins Remoting

image:images:ROOT:network-workgroup.png["Infrastructure", width=128]

Jenkins Remoting is a library, and executable Java archive, which implements the communication layer in Jenkins.
This includes the TCP-based communication protocols, remote procedure calls, class loading, data streaming, etc.
Currently Remoting is primarily used in communications between the Jenkins controller and its agents.
It is also used for the Remoting-based CLI and the {plugin}maven-plugin[Maven Integration plugin].

The Remoting sub-project includes the Remoting library itself, package for agents, and a number of Remoting-specific plugins and core modules.

== Jenkins Configuration as Code

image:images:ROOT:logos/JCasC/JCasC.svg["Jenkins Configuration as Code", width=128]

Setting up Jenkins is a complex process, as both Jenkins and its plugins require some tuning and configuration,
with dozens of parameters to set within the web UI manage section.

Jenkins Configuration as Code allows to define this whole configuration as a simple, human-friendly, plain text yaml syntax. Without any manual step this configuration can be validated and applied to a Jenkins controller in fully a reproducible way. With JCasC setting up a new Jenkins controller will become a no-brainer event.

== Jenkins Operator for Kubernetes

image:images:ROOT:logos/kubernetes-operator/256.png["Jenkins Operator", width=128]

The Jenkins Operator is a link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/[*Kubernetes Native Operator*] which manages operations for Jenkins on Kubernetes.
It has been built with Immutability and declarative Configuration as Code in mind.

This project enables community to run Jenkins in a cloud-native environments like Kubernetes.
Also, supports most of the public cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) in terms of additional capabilities like backups, observability and cloud security.
