This page aggregates project ideas for Google Summer of Code 2021. See more information about this project and applications on the xref:gsoc:index.adoc[Jenkins Google Summer of Code page].

Below you can find project ideas which have been proposed for this year. New ideas may be proposed by interested mentors or students (e.g. new features in the core, "write a plugin for MY_TOOL_OR_SERVICE", etc.). Project ideas without potential mentors will be considered though applicants may need to work with the community and GSoC org admins to find mentors. To add a new project idea, see: xref:gsoc:proposing-project-ideas.adoc[proposing project ideas].

All ideas have quick start guidelines and newbie-friendly issues referenced. We welcome contributors to join the mentor teams, and we invite students to submit project proposal applications in relation to these ideas.
