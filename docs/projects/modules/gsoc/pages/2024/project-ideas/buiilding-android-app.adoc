NOTE: This idea is published as a draft under active discussion, but it is confirmed in principle. It is FINE to apply to it. The scope and the suggested implementation may change significantly before the final version is published. Sections like quickstart guide and newbie-friendly issues may be also missing.

== Details
=== Background

Applying CI principles when building IOS applications brings its own challenges, different from those of more classical applications.
Topics such as _how to proceed_, _what are the successful patterns_, and _what are the pitfalls_ are poorly documented. 
It very often requires potential users and Jenkins Administrators to "reinvent the wheel".

Some experiments are link:https://github.com/gounthar/MyFirstAndroidAppBuiltByJenkins[available] and were link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmTdT4Y-uCw&ab_channel=JeanQuinze[presented publicly].

The proof of concept could be docker-compose based.
It would work under Windows, Linux, Vagrant, macOS (x86 and ARM), and _mostly_ on Gitpod.
It should be easily transposable to a production environment.
The demo/proof-of-concept would be composed of a Jenkins controller (configured with JCasc), an Android agent, a generic Docker agent, an Android emulator, and an Android device farm (link:https://github.com/DeviceFarmer[STF]).

The idea is to have a more precise status of what can be done now with Jenkins.
We could then amend the existing xref:solutions:ROOT:android.adoc[Android documentation] and describe architectures for:

* Standalone Android projects
* Android apps building farms
* Android distro building (customized AOSP)

//
// === Quick Start

// TBD
//
=== Skills to Study and Improve

- Android application development
- CI principle and practice
- Docker

=== Project Difficulty Level

Beginner to Intermediate

=== Project Size

175 hours

=== Expected outcomes

Details to be clarified interactively, together with the mentors, during the Contributor Application drafting phase. 

// === Newbie Friendly Issues
