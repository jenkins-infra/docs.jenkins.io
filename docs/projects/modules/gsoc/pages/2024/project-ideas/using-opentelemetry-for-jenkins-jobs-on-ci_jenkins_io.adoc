= Using OpenTelemetry for Jenkins Jobs on ci.jenkins.io

*Project goal:* To help enhance observability of Jenkins jobs on ci.jenkins.io via the introduction of the use of OpenTelemetry

*Skills to study/improve:* OpenTelemetry, Observability, DevOps

NOTE: This idea is published as a draft under active discussion, but it is confirmed in principle. It is FINE to apply to it. The scope and the suggested implementation may change significantly before the final version is published. Sections like quickstart guide and newbie-friendly issues may be also missing. As a contributor, you are welcome to request additional information and to join the discussions using channels linked on this page.

=== Motivation

Infra team would like to to perform deeper monitoring of specific jobs on ci.jenkins.io and infra.ci.jenkins.io.
The introduction of OpenTelemetry would allow us to do this.
OpenTelemetry is a collection of APIs, SDKs, and tools used to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) to help analyzing software performance and behavior.
With proper design and orchestration of the different moving parts of OpenTelemetry, we hope that the contributor completing the project will be able to gain invaluable experience in implementing observability tooling to the Jenkins project.
