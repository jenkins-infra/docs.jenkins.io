*Project goal:* To introduce a new authentication technique for both the Git plugin and Git Client plugin

*Skills to study/improve:* Java, Authentication techniques, Jenkins plugin development

NOTE: This idea is published as a draft under active discussion, but it is confirmed in principle. It is FINE to apply to it. The scope and the suggested implementation may change significantly before the final version is published. Sections like quickstart guide and newbie-friendly issues may be also missing. As a contributor, you are welcome to request additional information and to join the discussions using channels linked on this page.

== Details 
=== Background

Currently neither the Jenkins Git plugin nor the Jenkins Git Client plugin support the use of bearer token authentication. This project would add support for bearer token authentication to both plugins.
