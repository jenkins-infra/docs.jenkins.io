== Project Description

The aim is to create a Jenkins plugin that embeds a chatbot capable of understanding and responding to user inquiries about Jenkins. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, the chatbot will interpret user questions and provide relevant information from official documentation, plugin repositories, and community forums.

== Benefits to the Community

- *Enhanced User Experience:* Users can obtain information quickly without leaving the Jenkins environment.
- *Improved Accessibility:* Simplifies the learning curve for newcomers by providing instant answers to common questions.
- *Increased Productivity:* Reduces the time spent searching for resources, allowing users to focus on development and deployment tasks.

== Comparable Solutions

While there are existing AI chatbots in various domains, an AI assistant tailored specifically for Jenkins is limited. A community discussion highlighted interest in developing a Jenkins Assistant plugin, indicating a demand for such a tool. This project aims to fill that gap by offering a specialized solution within the Jenkins ecosystem.

== Project Scope

- *Chatbot Development:* Implement NLP models to process and understand user queries related to Jenkins.
- *Integration:* Develop a Jenkins plugin to host the chatbot, ensuring seamless interaction within the Jenkins user interface.
- *Data Sources:* Configure the chatbot to access and retrieve information from Jenkins documentation, plugin directories, and community forums.
- *User Interface:* Design an intuitive chat interface within Jenkins for user interactions.

== Quickstart

To get started:

1. *Familiarize Yourself with Jenkins Plugin Development:* Review the xref:developer:tutorial:index.adoc[Jenkins Plugin Tutorial].
2. *Explore Relevant AI Libraries:* Investigate NLP frameworks such as https://www.nltk.org/[NLTK], https://spacy.io/[spaCy], https://pytorch.org/[PyTorch], https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/[LlamaIndex], etc., that can be integrated into Python applications.
3. *Understand Existing Chatbot Implementations:* Study existing chatbot plugins or tools to gather insights into design and functionality.
