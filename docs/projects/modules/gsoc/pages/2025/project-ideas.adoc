This page aggregates project ideas for Google Summer of Code 2025. Refer to the xref:gsoc:index.adoc[Jenkins Google Summer of Code page] for more information about this project and applications.

Below you can find project ideas that have been proposed for this year. New ideas may be proposed by interested mentors or GSoC contributors, such as new features in the core or "write a plugin for MY_TOOL_OR_SERVICE". Project ideas without potential mentors will be considered, though applicants may need to work with the community and GSoC org admins to find mentors. To add a new project idea, see: xref:gsoc:proposing-project-ideas.adoc[proposing project ideas].
