= Cloud Features for External Workspace Manager Plugin 

*Project goal:* Add support of provisioning workspaces from cloud services

*Skills to study/improve:* Java, Cloud-based storage (e.g. Amazon EFS)

 

We wish to add Cloud features to the Jenkins External Workspace Manager Plugin.

This would allow Jenkins workspaces to be cloud based or located remotely, rather than being local.
These features include:

* Cloud-based storage support (link:https://groups.google.com/d/msg/jenkinsci-dev/z40kn8IqFb8/YkdgbuScCgAJ[discussion])
* Support use of multiple discard strategies
* Integration with the core's “Discard old builds” feature
* Improvements to data retention policies (e.g.
{jira}JENKINS-48715[],
{jira}JENKINS-2111[],
{jira}JENKINS-38764[])
* Workspace usage statistics
* Improvements to workspace usage statistics
* Better workspace cleanup management, e.g. matrix workspaces cleanup link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-27329[JENKINS-27329]
