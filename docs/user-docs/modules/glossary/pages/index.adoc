NOTE: The [glossary] delimiter in AsciiDoctor doesn't autogenerate anchors for
each of the terms below. Which means that if we want to cross-reference terms
directly from other documents we need to include an inline anchor.

Additionally, because these inline anchors don't attach to section headings,
cross referencing must include the appropriate display text, for example:

  MyTerm [#myterm] this is the definition of MyTerm

Should be cross-referenced with:

  xref:#myterm[MyTerm]

To ensure it is rendered appropriately.

== General Terms

[glossary]
[#agent]
=== xref:using-jenkins:using-agents.adoc[Agent] 

An agent is typically a machine, or container, which connects to a Jenkins controller and executes tasks when directed by the controller.

[#artifact]
=== Artifact

An immutable file generated during a xref:#build[Build] or xref:#pipeline[Pipeline] run which is *archived* onto the Jenkins xref:#controller[Controller] for later retrieval by users.

[#build]
=== Build

Result of a single execution of a xref:#job[Job]

[#cloud]
=== Cloud 

A System Configuration which provides dynamic xref:#agent[Agent] provisioning and allocation, such as that provided by the {plugin}azure-vm-agents[Azure VM Agents] or {plugin}ec2[Amazon EC2] plugins.

[#controller]
=== Controller

The central, coordinating process which stores configuration, loads plugins, and renders the various user interfaces for Jenkins.

[#core]
=== Core

The primary Jenkins application (`jenkins.war`) which provides the basic web UI, configuration, and foundation upon which xref:#plugin[Plugin] can be built.

[#downstream]
=== Downstream 

A configured xref:#pipeline[Pipeline] or xref:#job[Job] which is triggered as part of the execution of a separate Pipeline or Job.

[#executor]
=== Executor 

A slot for execution of work defined by a xref:#pipeline[Pipeline] or xref:#job[Job] on a xref:#node[Node]. A Node may have zero or more Executors configured which corresponds to how many concurrent Jobs or Pipelines are able to execute on that Node.

[#fingerprint]
=== Fingerprint

A hash considered globally unique to track the usage of an xref:#artifact[Artifact] or other entity across multiple xref:#pipeline[Pipelines] or xref:#job[jobs].

[#folder]
=== Folder

An organizational container for xref:#pipeline[Pipelines] and/or xref:#job[jobs], similar to folders on a file system.

[#item]
=== Item

An entity in the web UI corresponding to either a:xref:#folder[Folder], xref:#pipeline[Pipeline], or xref:#job[job].

[#jenkins-url]
=== Jenkins URL

The main url for the jenkins application, as visited by a user. e.g. https://ci.jenkins.io/

[#job]
=== Job

A user-configured description of work which Jenkins should perform, such as building a piece of software, etc.

[#kubernetes]
=== Kubernetes 

Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. See xref:installing-jenkins:kubernetes.adoc[Installing Jenkins / Kubernetes] for more info.

[#label]
=== Label 

User-defined text for grouping xref:#agent[Agents], typically by similar functionality or capability. For example `linux` for Linux-based agents or `docker` for Docker-capable agents.

[#lts]
=== LTS

A long-term support xref:#release[Release] line of Jenkins products, becoming available for downloads every 12 weeks. See https://www.jenkins.io/download/lts[this page] for more info.

[#master]
=== Master

A deprecated term, synonymous with xref:#controller[Controller].

[#node]
=== xref:managing:nodes.adoc[Node]

A machine which is part of the Jenkins environment and capable of executing xref:#pipeline[Pipelines] or xref:#job[jobs]. Both the xref:#controller[Controller] and xref:#agent[Agents] are considered to be Nodes.

[#project]
=== Project [#project]

A deprecated term, synonymous with xref:#job[job].

[#pipeline]
=== Pipeline

A user-defined model of a continuous delivery pipeline, for more read the xref:user-docs:pipeline:index.adoc[Pipeline chapter] in this handbook.

[#plugin]
=== Plugin

An extension to Jenkins functionality provided separately from Jenkins xref:#core[Core].

[#publisher]
=== Publisher

Part of a xref:#build[Build] after the completion of all configured xref:#step[Steps] which publishes reports, sends notifications, etc. A publisher may report xref:#stable[Stable] or xref:#unstable[Unstable] result depending on the result of its processing and its configuration. For example, if a JUnit test fails, then the whole JUnit publisher may report the build result as xref:#unstable[Unstable].

[#resource-root-url]
=== Resource Root URL 

A secondary url used to serve potentially untrusted content (especially build artifacts). This url is distinct from the xref:#jenkins-url[Jenkins URL].

[#release]
=== Release

An event, indicating availability of Jenkins distribution products or one of Jenkins plugins. Jenkins products belong either to xref:#lts[LTS] or weekly Release lines.

[#stage]
=== Stage

`stage` is part of Pipeline, and used for defining a conceptually distinct subset of the entire Pipeline, for example: "Build", "Test", and "Deploy", which is used by many plugins to visualize or present Jenkins Pipeline status/progress.

[#step]
=== Step

A single task; fundamentally steps tell Jenkins _what_ to do inside of a xref:#pipeline[Pipeline] or xref:#job[job]. See xref:pipeline:getting-started.adoc[Pipelines / Getting Started] and xref:pipeline:jenkinsfile.adoc[Pipeline / Using a jenkinsfile] for more info.

[#trigger]
=== Trigger 

A criteria for triggering a new xref:#pipeline[Pipeline] run or xref:#job[job].

[#update-center]
=== Update Center 

Hosted inventory of plugins and plugin metadata to enable plugin installation from within Jenkins.

[#upstream]
=== Upstream 

A configured xref:#pipeline[Pipeline] or xref:#job[job] which triggers a separate Pipeline or Job as part of its execution.

[#view]
=== View 

A way of displaying the data of Jenkins in a dashboard style. This is an extensible object, so there are lots of different ways to list xref:#job[jobs], show trends, and analyze data.

[#workspace]
=== Workspace 

A disposable directory on the file system of a xref:#node[Node] where work can be done by a xref:#pipeline[Pipeline] or xref:#job[job]. Workspaces are typically left in place after a xref:#build[Build] or xref:#pipeline[Pipeline] run completes unless specific Workspace cleanup policies
have been put in place on the Jenkins xref:#controller[Controller]. 

[#build-status]
== Build Status

[#aborted]
=== Aborted

The xref:#build[Build] was interrupted before it reaches its expected end. For example, the user has stopped it manually or there was a time-out.

[#failed]
=== Failed

The xref:#build[Build] had a fatal error.

[#stable]
=== Stable

The xref:#build[Build] was xref:#successful[Successful] and no xref:#publisher[Publisher] reports it as xref:#unstable[Unstable].

[#successful]
=== Successful

The xref:#build[Build] has no compilation errors.

[#unstable]
=== Unstable

The xref:#build[Build] had some errors, but they were not fatal. A xref:#build[Build] is unstable if it was built successfully and one or more publishers report it unstable. For example if the JUnit publisher is configured and a test fails then the xref:#build[Build] will be marked unstable.
