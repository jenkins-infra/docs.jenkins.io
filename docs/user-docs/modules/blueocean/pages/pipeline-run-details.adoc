== Pipeline Run Status

Blue Ocean makes it easy to see the status of the current Pipeline Run, by changing the color of the top menu bar to match the status:

* Blue for "In progress"
* Green for "Passed" 
* Yellow for "Unstable"
* Red for "Failed" 
* Gray for "Aborted"

== Special cases

Blue Ocean is optimized for working with Pipelines in Source Control, but can display details for other kinds of projects.
Blue Ocean offers the same xref:#tabs[ tabs] for all supported projects types, but those tabs display different information depending on the type.

=== Pipelines outside of Source Control

For Pipelines that are not based in Source Control, Blue Ocean shows the "Commit Id", "Branch", and "Changes", but those fields are left blank.
In this case, the top menu bar does not include the "Edit" option.

=== Freestyle Projects

For Freestyle projects, Blue Ocean offers the same xref:#tabs[ tabs], but the Pipeline tab only displays the console log output.
The "Rerun" or "Edit" options are not available in the top menu bar.

=== Matrix projects

Matrix projects are not supported in Blue Ocean.
Viewing a Matrix project will redirect to the "Classic UI" view for that project.

[#tabs]
== Tabs

Each tab of the Run Detail view provides information on a specific aspect of a run.

[#pipeline]
=== Pipeline

*Pipeline* is the default tab and gives an overall view of the flow of this Pipeline Run.
It shows each stage and parallel branch, the steps in those stages, and the console output from those steps.
The overview image above shows a successful Pipeline run.
If a particular step during the run fails, this tab automatically defaults to showing the console log from the failed step.
The image below shows a failed Run.

=== Changes

The *Changes* tab displays the information of any changes made between the most recently completed and current runs.
This includes the commit id for the change, change author, message, and date completed.

=== Tests

The *Tests* tab shows information about test results for this run.
This tab only contains information if a test result publishing step is present, such as the "Publish JUnit test results" (`junit`) step.
If no results are recorded, this table displays a message.
If all tests pass, this tab will report the total number of passing tests.
If there are failures, the tab will display log details from the failures as shown below.

When a previous run has failures, and the current run fixes those failures, this tab notes the fixes and displays their logs.

=== Artifacts

The *Artifacts* tab shows a list of any artifacts saved using the "Archive Artifacts" (`archiveArtifacts`) step.
Selecting an item in the list downloads it.
The full output log from the Run can be downloaded from this list.
