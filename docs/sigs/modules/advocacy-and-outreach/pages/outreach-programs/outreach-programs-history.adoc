= Outreach Past Programs

This page lists the community programs we've supported in the past.

== Community Bridge

In 2019 we have started evaluation of the link:https://communitybridge.org/[Community Bridge] portal
provided by link:https://www.linuxfoundation.org/[Linux Foundation].
This website provides ways to run internship programs and to fund them,
and we would like to use it to run projects outside of the Google Summer of Code timeframe.
You can find the Jenkins project page link:https://people.communitybridge.org/project/bce45251-1ff4-4131-9699-0a0017b31495[here].

Our first project on Community Bridge is xref:projects:ROOT:index.adoc/jcasc/dev-tools/[Developer Tools for Jenkins Configuration-as-Code] (Aug-Nov 2019).
We are interested in onboarding more projects, and we invite Jenkins contributors and potential mentees to reach out to us.

To contact us regarding this program, send us a message on the

The https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/[Google Season of Docs] program brings together open source and technical writers communities for the benefit of both. The program raises awareness of open source, of docs, and of technical writing.

The Jenkins organization was accepted to Google Season of Docs in 2020.
The xref:2.452.x@user-docs:installing-jenkins:kubernetes.adoc[Jenkins on Kubernetes project] created an installation guide for Jenkins on Kubernetes.
See the link:https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2020/12/04/gsod-project-report/[project report] by link:https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/zaycodes/[Zainab Abubakar] for details of the 2020 project.
We look forward to additional Jenkins project opportunities with Google Season of Docs.
