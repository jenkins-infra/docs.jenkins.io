image:images:ROOT:logos/formal/256.png[Logo,width=192,float=right,role=float-gap]
This special interest group offers a venue for all kinds of platform support discussions:
Java, Operating Systems, Architectures, Docker, Packaging, Web Containers, etc. 

The SIG works on defining platform support policies, coordinating platform support efforts with contributors and external communities, and reviewing proposals in the area.

== Description

The special interest group offers a venue for all kinds of platform support discussions:
Java, Operating Systems, Architectures, Docker, Packaging, Web Containers, etc.

The group focuses on technologies used in Jenkins:

* Java Virtual Machines: versions, compatibility and optimizations
* Operating Systems: native components, packaging
* Architectures and platforms
* Web Containers

Platform SIG cooperates with other groups like the xref:docs:index.adoc[Documentation SIG].

== Topics

* Defining platform support policies, including
** xref:user-docs:platform-information:support-policy-java.adoc[Java support policy]
** xref:user-docs:platform-information:support-policy-linux.adoc[Linux support policy] 
** xref:user-docs:platform-information:support-policy-windows.adoc[Windows support policy]
** xref:user-docs:platform-information:support-policy-web-browsers.adoc[Browser support policy]
** xref:user-docs:platform-information:support-policy-servlet-containers.adoc[Servlet container support policy]
* Coordinating effort on new platform support (e.g. {jep}211/README.adoc[Java 11 Support in Jenkins])
* Working with external communities on better platform support and packaging
(e.g. ARM architecture support, adapting RedHat packaging to best practices, using systemd, etc.)
* Reviewing JEPs submitted in the area

== Projects

This section lists the key initiatives being handled by the Platform SIG.
See the link:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bDfUdtjpwoX0HO2PRnfqns_TROBOK8tmP6SgVhubr2Y/edit?usp=sharing[SIG meeting notes] for more information about the ongoing projects.
See the link:https://www.jenkins.io/project/roadmap[Jenkins Project roadmap] for a 

== Docker images

Jenkins project ships official controller and agent images,
and we would like to offer wide support of platforms and architectures there.
Scope of interest:

* Enabling official images to run on Arm, IBM s390x, and other platforms
* Official controller and agent images for Windows
* Support multi-architecture Docker images
* Enabling continuous delivery for Jenkins packaging
** Experimental DockerHub organization and deployments from ci.jenkins.io ( {jep}217/README.adoc[JEP-217] )

== Plugin management

We are interested to improve plugin management experience in Jenkins.
To do that, we work on new tools for Jenkins users and maintainers.
Scope of interest:

* xref:user-docs:managing:plugins.adoc[Plugin management in Jenkins Web UI]
* link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker#preinstalling-plugins[Plugin management in Jenkins Docker images]
* link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-installation-manager-tool[Plugin Installation Manager CLI Tool]
* link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/bom[Bill of Materials for Jenkins plugins]

== Java support

In our SIG we are interested to offer a wide range of supported JVMs.
See the current list of supported versions xref:/doc/administration/requirements/java/[here].

Scope of interest:

* Maintaining Java 17 and Java 21 support in Jenkins and driving adoption of new Java versions
* Migration to link:https://adoptium.net/[Eclipse Temurin] in Docker images
* Support for future mainstream JVM versions (Java 25, ...)
* Support for perspective virtual machines like link:https://www.graalvm.org/[GraalVM] or link:https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus], including native executable packaging

== Windows support

Many Jenkins users run controller or agents on Windows.
We are interested to support modern Windows platforms and to offer official distributions for the platform.

Scope of interest:

* xref:user-docs:platform-information:support-policy-windows.adoc[Windows support policy]
* Native Windows installers (MSI), including the ongoing link:https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2019/02/01/windows-installers/[rework of Windows installers]
* Official Docker images for Windows controllers and agents
* Installation of controllers and agents as Windows services
* Official link:https://chocolatey.org/packages/jenkins[Jenkins Chocolatey package]
