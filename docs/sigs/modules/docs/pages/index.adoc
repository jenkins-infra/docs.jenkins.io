The SIG offers a venue for all kinds of documentation creation, improvement, and delivery.

The group focuses on documentation for Jenkins including:

* xref:user-docs:ROOT:index.adoc[User documentation] - Using Jenkins
** xref:tutorials:ROOT:index.adoc[Tutorials]
** xref:user-docs:ROOT:index.adoc[User Handbook]
** References like xref:user-docs:pipeline:syntax.adoc[Pipeline Syntax] and link:https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/[Pipeline Steps]

  Also, implementation solutions like xref:solutions:ROOT:pipeline.adoc[Pipeline]

The Documentation SIG also collaborates with other groups.
For example, we cooperate with the xref:platform:index.adoc[Platform SIG] on platform topics and the xref:advocacy-and-outreach:index.adoc[Advocacy and Outreach SIG] on community topics.

If you have any questions or ideas, please feel free to reach out to us using the channels listed on the right panel.

[#ongoing-projects]
== Projects

This section lists some of the past projects completed under the direction of this SIG.
See the link:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ygRZnVtoIvuEKpwNeF_oVRVCV5NKcZD1_HMtWlUZguo/edit?usp=sharing[SIG meeting notes] for more information about ongoing projects.

=== Google Season of Docs

Google Season of Docs brings together open source communities and technical writers for the benefit of both.
The program raises awareness of open source, of documentation, and of technical writing.
There are no current plans to participate in Google Season of Docs, but if you are curious, refer to our link:/sigs/docs/gsod[Google Season of Docs page] for past documentation project ideas and other information.

As of May 2025, the Google Season of Docs has program concluded.
This conclusion was originally announced in a Google Summer of Code user group and is currently displayed on the main link:https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs[GSoD page].
More information will be made available at a later time via the link:https://opensource.googleblog.com/[Google Open Source Blog].

[#plugin-documentation-on-github]
=== Plugin documentation on GitHub

Previously, the SIG was xref:dev-docs:publishing:wiki-page.adoc#migrating-from-wiki-to-github[migrating plugin documentation from Jenkins Wiki to GitHub].
Documentation in the plugin GitHub repository provides a good user experience for Jenkins users seeking documentation.
By performing this migration, plugin maintainers can now follow the documentation-as-code approach and make documentation changes a part of the pull requests.
It also creates an opportunity to review the documentation changes and add documentation contributor recognition, especially if the story is combined with link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/.github/blob/master/.github/release-drafter.adoc[changelog automation].

As of March 2024, we have more than 1,000 plugins which already use GitHub as a documentation source, but there are still link:https://reports.jenkins.io/jenkins-plugin-migration.html[hundreds of plugins to migrate].
We invite contributors to participate in the project and to help us with migrating the docs.
It is also a great opportunity to update and copy-edit the documentation.

Useful links:

* link:https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2019/10/21/plugin-docs-on-github/[Documentation migration guidelines blog post]
* {jira}JENKINS-59467[Template issue for plugin documentation migration to GitHub]
* link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jenkinsci-dev/VSdfVMDIW-A[Announcement in the developer mailing list]
* xref:dev-docs:publishing:documentation.adoc#plugin-pages[Using GitHub as a source of plugin documentation]

=== Plugin site integration with GitHub

The link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/[Jenkins Plugin site] currently uses GitHub to get plugin documentation (see above) and tags (using GitHub topics).
Release information is also pulled from GitHub releases.
There are still some areas for improvement, such as parsing of CHANGELOG.md files to get release information for plugins that don't use GitHub releases.
This project was tracked in the {jira}WEBSITE-637[] EPIC.

Useful links:

* xref:dev-docs:publishing:documentation.adoc[Publishing Plugin Documentation]

[#user-guide]
=== User Guide Rework

Jenkins user topics are included in the current xref:user-docs:ROOT:index.adoc[Jenkins Handbook].
link:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nA8xVOkyKmZ8oTYSLdwjborT0w-BpBNNZT0nxR9deZ8/edit#gid=1087292709[Feedback requests] are frequently received to improve user documentation.
Common improvement themes include adding migration of the documentation from Wiki, pipeline examples with each of the pipeline steps, additional tutorials for new users, better search and navigation.

Links: 

* link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/projects/1[GitHub Project]

[#administrator-guide]
=== Administrator Guide

Jenkins administration topics are included in the current link:/doc/book[Jenkins Handbook].
Since these topics are already included, we are not separating the administration topics into a separate volume.
Upon reviewing other project documentation, very few, if any, have separate administrator guides.
Due to this, we are keeping the User Handbook as it is now, where administration topics are part of the overall documentation.

[#solution-pages]
=== Solution Pages

Jenkins xref:solutions:ROOT:index.adoc[solution pages] highlight specific use cases for Jenkins users.
Those solutions include SCM provider solutions (xref:solutions:ROOT:github.adoc[GitHub], xref:solutions:ROOT:bitbucketserver.adoc[Bitbucket]),
programming language solutions (xref:solutions:ROOT:python.adoc[Python], xref:solutions:ROOT:ruby.adoc[Ruby], xref:solutions:ROOT:c.adoc[C/C++], xref:solutions:ROOT:java.adoc[Java], and xref:solutions:ROOT:php.adoc[PHP]),
and execution environment solutions (xref:solutions:ROOT:python.adoc[Pipeline], xref:solutions:ROOT:docker.adoc[Docker], xref:solutions:ROOT:embedded.adoc[Embedded], and xref:solutions:ROOT:android.adoc[Android]).
An excellent xref:solutions:ROOT:index.adoc[opening page] has been provided by link:https://github.com/zbynek[Zbynek Konecny].
Additional use cases and user stories are being collected by link:https://github.com/alyssat[Alyssa Tong].

The appearance and navigation of those solution pages has been improved since originally starting this project.
The existing pages have been revisited and improved so that users of specific solutions can find what they need on jenkins.io.
This project was tracked in the {jira}:WEBSITE-742[] EPIC.
